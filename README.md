# Sustain-Website
This a website that I created with my team at Superposition IV. We wanted to create something to help the environment. The website has a search feature to browse eco-friendly products, a explore page to find resurces for being eco-friendly, and a comments feature, powered with python and flask, for people to leave comments that they have.
